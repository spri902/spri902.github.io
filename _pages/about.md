Hi, I'm Parker. 

I'm an Earth Scientist at Pacific Northwest National Lab (PNNL) and a PhD student at the University of Washington.

As a researcher, I've worked on multiple topics within marine seismology and several mission spaces across DOE and DOD. I enjoy straddling the line between applied and experimental science and occasionally blur the line between scientist and engineer. 

Much of my work lies at the intersection of geophysics (particularly seismology), data science, and distributed fiber optic sensing. I work with both terrestrial and submarine optical fiber networks. I use optimization and inverse theory along with high performance scientific computing and machine learning methods to solve problems related to national security, enhanced geothermal energy, and ocean science. 

In recent years, I have developed a strong interest in building custom instruments/sensor and DAQs. As is often the case in R&D, off the shelf solutions may not exist so we need to improve on what’s available or build it ourselves. 

I work with a team that specializes in computational and applied geophysics. We create software and develop algorithms for imaging and monitoring dynamic processes in the subsurface. We also design and build highly customized geophysical sensor arrays along with flow and stimulation systems for enhanced geothermal systems, environmental monitoring and remediation, as well as national security. Our capability comprises expertise across a wide range of fields relevant to subsurface science and engineering(e.g. seismology, data science, optical engineering, hydrology, electrical and EM geophysics, geomechanics, gravity, and mechanical and environmental engineering)

In years past, I researched microseismicity at the Juan De Fuca mid ocean ridge system. I worked to better understand the connections between tidal triggering, moment release and the state of stress during a submarine volcanic eruption cycle through the lenses of seismology, data analysis and geo-statistics.
